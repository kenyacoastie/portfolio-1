          <h3>South Park Game</h3>
          <p>This is a twist on a classic "catch em all" game, using a couple of my favorite cartoon characters.
          Move Cartman around using the right and left arrow keys and try and catch all of the falling cheesy poofs.
          Each cheesy poof is worth 5 points. Level one is up to 25 points. Be on the lookout for a special appearance
          that's worth extra points!</p>

          <h3>Music Playlist App</h3>
          <p>Music has always been a passion of mine, and with the advent of apps like Spotify, sharing music has never been easier.
          My friends and I are always creating playlists for any occassion, a birthday party, a BBQ, a road trip, or even just a
          Saturday night spent inside. I saw this project as an opportunity to have a centralized place to create music playlists
          from scratch, create it in a music app like Spotify, and then share it with friends.</p>

          <h3>Tech.ie</h3>
          <p>Our goal was to create a central place for fellow techies to rate and review the different
          technologies that they use. This would inform the community as to what technologies are
          trending, essential, obsolete, or just plain cool. Built by developers, for developers, we
          hope for this app to be an extension of the developer community and conducive to collaboration.</p>
